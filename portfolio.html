               <h4><img src="1051328.png" class="skill-image"><br>HTML</h4>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, and I have extensive experience in using it to structure clean, semantic, and accessible web pages. From building basic layouts to integrating complex multimedia elements, I ensure that the HTML code I write adheres to industry standards and best practices, making websites both SEO-friendly and user-friendly. My deep understanding of HTML allows me to craft websites that are both scalable and efficient.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h4><img src="CSS.png" class="skill-image"><br>CSS</h4>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is my go-to tool for bringing web designs to life. With a strong command of CSS, I can create visually appealing, responsive, and interactive web pages that adapt seamlessly across devices. From crafting sleek layouts to mastering animations, transitions, and media queries, I focus on writing clean and maintainable CSS code. My expertise in CSS ensures that every website I work on not only looks great but also performs smoothly.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h4><img src="c-logo.png" class="skill-image"><br>C/C++</h4>
                <p>C/C++ are powerful programming languages. With a solid background in both, I have experience in writing efficient, optimized code for a variety of applications, from system-level programming to game development. My proficiency in C allows me to manage memory, work with low-level hardware interfaces, and optimize performance. With C++, I leverage object-oriented programming principles to create modular and high-performance applications.
